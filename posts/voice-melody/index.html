    <p>Take the pitch of people's voices. Stick them on a staff. You get music.</p>
<p>Some people's voices have large intervals at a high frequency. Some people's
voices have a very fast rhythm, some people's voices have a very slow rhythm.
Some people's voices have a very small range of pitches. Some people's voices
have a very large range of pitches.</p>
<p>Some way to classify voices into what traits they have or what they most
resemble. You can write some AI to analyze old speeches and generate groups of
people that speak very similarly. See if there is correlation with popularity or
