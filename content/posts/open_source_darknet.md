It cannot be that hard to run a darknet marketplace. All of the parts can be done completely anonymously, but none have really stood the test of time. FBI and DEA and all the of the international crime agencies find them, but it's always trivial how they do. They searched google for a username that ran the site and a page showed up with an email address. No way it takes a whole government to do that.

Technology has definitely allowed for new avenues of crime, almost to the point that crime is a constant and will continue to be. The only way to stop crime is to stop people from wanting to do it. But that's not possible. So we have to deal with it.
