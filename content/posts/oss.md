Possible OSS repos I should contribute to:

- Material UI - pretty old already, front end stuff vomit
- GHC - would require learning a lot about how GHC works which might blow my brain. already complicated enough, but heard community is very good
- uBlockOrigin - slight vice, but could be fun + have passion
- systemd - would be a lot of learning but would be the dream, stuff that is core to building software and running software
